}

//Declarations (1) and (4) cannot occur in the same class definition.
//because method f() is static and a is not.

//Declarations (1) and (2) cannot occur in the same class definition.
//variable names must be different.

//Local variables can have same name as member variables. The local variables will simply shadow the member variables with the same names.
//Declaration (4) defines a static method that tries to access a variable named 'a' which is not locally declared.
//Since the method is static, this access will only be valid if variable 'a' is declared static within the class.
// Therefore declarations (1) and (4) cannot occur in the same definition.
